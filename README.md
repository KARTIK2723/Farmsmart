# Farmsmart
FarmSmart is a smart agriculture web application that helps farmers make better decisions for crop selection. It uses soil type, location (district-wise for Uttar Pradesh), and rainfall data to suggest the best crop. The platform also provides government schemes, an AI chatbot, and a user-friendly interface for farmers.
